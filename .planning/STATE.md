## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Missouri-first compliance docs: validate MO workflow before expanding to other states
- Flat folder model: single-level folders per client (no nested hierarchy)
- Seed BoldSign templates with stubs: decouple template creation from code; IDs pasted later
- Session-only AI chat: conversation history in memory only, not persisted to Firestore
- ShowingTime via iCal: no public API available; webcal feeds are the only integration path

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2 pre-work: Verify BoldSign senderDetail field names and sendwithtemplate merge field parameter structure against current API docs before planning Phase 2
- Phase 3 pre-work: Do a test BoldSign webhook delivery and log the raw payload to confirm header name and event payload structure before coding the webhook handler
- Phase 5 pre-work: Inspect a live ShowingTime iCal feed to confirm STATUS, SEQUENCE, EXDATE, and DESCRIPTION field behavior before coding the sync function
- All phases: Verify functions/package.json has "engines": { "node": "18" } before any Cloud Function work
